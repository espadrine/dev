Camp
====

The following directory contains server configuration files.


camp.js
-------

This file is a local copy of the camp.js ScoutCamp file. It should be imported
from the dev.js file.

dev.js
------

The server is started by this file. However, in order to launch it, one should
go in the /scout/ folder and, from there, type in the following:

  ./run

That launches the dev file, setting the scout/ folder as the htdocs root.
