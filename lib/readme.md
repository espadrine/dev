Camp
====

The following directory contains server configuration files.


camp.js
-------

This file is a local copy of the camp.js ScoutCamp file. It should be imported
from the dev.js file.

../server.js
------------

The server is started by this file. However, in order to launch it, one should
go in the / root folder and, from there, type in the following:

    make

That launches the server file, with the necessary requirements.
